		  world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a
		  round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is
		  no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all
		  men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be
		  truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory. Science cuts two ways,
		  of course; its products can be used for both good and evil."
